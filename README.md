# Search for the real culprit, alarming CO2 levels
## The region is based on United States on a broader sense, domain category is levels of CO2 and environmental impact assessment by energy generation.

United States Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) - Energy Generation
Global CO2 PPM Data at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich, Switzerland

It is an accepted fact that the rise of global CO2 levels PPM has given rise to global warming and is strongly co-related to climate change.
But the argument has shifted to "Who is responsible?"
This is a question that needs immediate answering so that we know where to cut down.
Now the common targets are industrialized processes of combustion of fossil fuels which generate carbon-dioxide as a by-product, the energy produced is used for many things such as in the form of electricity, heat for process heating etc. 
Reacting to this, people favor the more "healthy" methods of energy generation such as hydroelectric, solar and wind.
But this question crossed my mind many times in the recent past that if the solution was so simple, switching from fossil fuel based generation to solar, hydroelectric, then why aren't we witnessing a dramatic change?
Well, United States being the nation most forward in development, it would serve as a great template to compare its energy generation techniques over the years and the rising CO2 levels. 
We can min-max normalize data from all these sectors and compare to see if there is an co-relation between the rise and fall of the specific types of methods of generation of energy with the rising levels of CO2.
And is the green revolution really around? Are we finally moving away from fossil fuel based production?
So let's dive right in!

Well, as expected there was a string co-relation between the "Total Emissions" and "Harmful Emissions" as fossil fuel based energy production continue to dominate the market, answering the question that a successful green revolution is still not a reality.

The rise of harmful production techniques keeps up with the CO2 levels BUT interestingly the fall of them around 2009 did not impact the CO2 rise as expected.
The rise and fall of safe production techniques DO NOT impact the rise of CO2 levels as expected as well.
This leads us to believing that the rise of quantity of energy production driven by industrialization and urbanization is not the leading cause of the rise of CO2.
In fact, as an engineer, my eyes roll directly towards the methods of energy production rather than the fuel powering the production used. I would definitely look into the methods of energy production, the most common in all techniques is the use of the turbines in the production techniques, so my sight would be there as well. But for now, we can't really blame the fuel driving the production entirely.
We must also look into the method and factors surrounding it.

Cairo's principles are upheld,
  Truthfulness - Extracting data for a specific year gap and not projecting and extending where data isn't available is of key importance here. Also, max-min normalization to compare data is key here as with varied values of data available here it is very easy to deceive general viewers with the units. Also, going in with an open mind was of key importance here as being an engineer and having studied environmental science on a social level alot has driven me to blame certain innocent aspects of industrialization and urbanization. So avoiding self-deception was very key here. 

  Beauty - Removing the spines, adding alpha to the production techniques to improve visibility and removing the irrelevant y-axis values as they are normalized and are just being used for comparison. The color coding is also done in a way to improve visibility, with the legend provided conveniently at the upper left.

  Functionality - Increasing the data-ink ration by getting rid of the grids and the spines and more importantly the alphas for the techniques provide perfect medium for functional comparison of the line plots. The legend conveniently sits at the upper left, away from the line plots, yet in perfect site to provide a glance at any moment. The plot type used was line plot after normalization is the perfect way to find a visualized solution for the question.

  Insightfulness - Certainly the only eureka moment was seeing the strong co-relation between total and harmful techniques as we are still pretty far from a green revolution. The ups and downs in the production techniques and the relative comparison of it with the rising CO2 levels provides us a great insight that the general notion that "the fuel powering the methods is to be blamed rather than the method itself" is not exactly accurate. We most certainly need to look into all possibilities.
